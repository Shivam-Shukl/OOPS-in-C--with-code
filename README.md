# OOPS-in-C-with-code
This repository demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using C++. It includes well-structured code examples that illustrate the four fundamental pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. The goal is to provide a hands-on guide to C++ OOP for students, developers, and interview preparation.
